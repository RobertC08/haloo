## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Always start with a PLAN before any code.**
   - Structure:
     - Goal  
     - Context  
     - Approach  
     - Expected Output  
     - Dependencies  
     - Testing/Validation  
   - Wait for approval: ✅ “Proceed” before coding.

2. **Message Prefixes (for clarity):**
   - `PLAN:` → Request roadmap  
   - `CODE:` → Request implementation  
   - `FIX:` → Debug or correct an issue  
   - `DOC:` → Documentation or explanation  
   - `TASK:` → Describe new feature  
   - `REVIEW:` → Request optimization or cleanup

3. **Code Standards:**
   - Follow WooCommerce + WordPress best practices.
   - Use hooks, filters, and shortcodes — never edit core files.
   - Code must be modular, documented, and safe.
   - Suggest file paths for new files.
   - Avoid direct SQL (use `$wpdb` safely).

4. **Session Format:**
   - Start with:
     ```
     CURRENT STATUS: (brief summary)
     TODAY’S GOAL: (main focus)
     ```
   - End with:
     ```
     SESSION SUMMARY:
     - Completed:
     - Next Steps:
     - Notes:
     ```

5. **Quality & Testing:**
   - Sanitize and escape all data; use nonces.
   - Use WooCommerce APIs for performance.
   - Ensure responsive UI and smooth checkout.
   - Test cart, checkout, payments, and mobile UX.

6. **Feature Completion Format:**
   - ✅ Feature implemented and tested.  
   - 🔁 Next Step: (follow-up item)
